Nextjs Bank landing page with Tailwindcss

</div>

![cover](./public/cover.png)
A simple static bank landing page using Nextjs & Tailwindcss made with ❤️. By doing this project, i learn that tailwindcss is messy to write (may be because i love writing my css from scratch 😅), and with the nextjs i can make simple static website easily (however i didn't learn the other topics such as routing, rendering methods, data fetching, optimizations etc.)
